          For many years, <strong>Bethany</strong> has been baking the most pies
          at her home. In 2015, we opened our fisrt store in Brussels (Belgium)
          in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over
          the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheesecakes,
          spicy apple pies... <i>the store became a success in no time</i>.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie
          Shop moved into a larger building. After receiving many request, it
          became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies
          from the confort of your own home and from anywere in the world. You
          are now looking at the result of this: our very own website, making it
          posible to order Bethany's delicius pies whenever you feel like it!
          <br />
          <br />
          Bethany is famous for using the best ingredients. This way, we can
          make sure that our pies are absolutely the best.
